## About the Project
This is a Command Line Interface Application, meant to simulate an Employee database where the user can perform many options to add a new employee, or new department as well as view the information on the database.  The user is presented with the following options:
  
     - Add Department
     - Add Role  
     - Add Employee  
     - View All Departments  
     - View All Roles  
     - View All Employees  
     - Update Employee Role  
     - Exit  

From the options above the user can intuitively follow the prompts given by the application to fill out and use the database.  A short video demonstrating this application can be found at the link below:
